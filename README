Sounds like `itÂ´s too late`. cuz there exists a lot of better SQLite tools to run queries.

### Query
[!Success] Currently only support query actions over well defined sqlite db files

#### Other actions
[!Success] Serach and connect any sqlite db file

[!Note] create new empty sqlite db files

## ToDo
Add more functionality for **_insert_**, **_update_**, and **_delete_**; also for **DDL** and create tables,views, and so on.
