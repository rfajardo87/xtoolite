# XTooLite
Simple SQLite query tool for sqlite3 db files

Built with  Python and libraries also built with Python language

#### Why XToolLite name
Well, it sounds like `itÂ´s too late`. cuz there exists a lot of better SQLite tools to run queries.

## Install and Run

Unzip `xtoolite.zip` file and drag and drop into `Applications` folder
### Query
> [!Tip]
> Currently only support query actions over well-defined sqlite3 db files; insert, update and delete works in a raw level

#### Other actions
> [!Tip]
> Search and connect any sqlite3 db file in your local machine

> [!Note]
> Create new empty sqlite3 db files

## ToDo
Add more functionality for **_insert_**, **_update_**, and **_delete_**; also for **DDL** and create tables,views, and so on.
